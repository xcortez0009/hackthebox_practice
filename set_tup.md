## Hack the box gives some basic steps to make sure you connect. My plan is to expand those a little further. 

Install software for managing virtual machines, such as VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, etc.


Create a Linux virtual machine. You can use a pre-made pentesting OS such as Kali Linux/Parrot Linux, or build your own toolkit from scratch. We do not recommend using Windows as your primary attack environment.

Run openvpn XYZ.ovpn in terminal.

Have fun! Find IP addresses of attackable machines on the Active Machines page.
